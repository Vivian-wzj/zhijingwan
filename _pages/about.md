<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a 2nd-year PhD student of [AIM Lab](http://aim-nercms.whu.edu.cn/) at [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), extremely fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Zheng Wang](https://wangzwhu.github.io/home/). I am also a visiting student supervised by [Prof.Shin'ichi Satoh](https://researchmap.jp/satoh/) in [National Institute of Informatics (NII)](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/). Throughout my studies, I have been fortunate to collaborate closely with [Zhixiang Wang](https://lightchaserx.github.io/). I completed my M.Phil at [Wuhan University of Science and Technology](https://en.wust.edu.cn/) with [Prof. Xin Xu](http://www.vai-lab.com/member/XuXin.html).

My research interests are subset selection for computer vision and  data-efficient AI.

[Contributing Dimension Structure of Deep Feature for Coreset Selection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16193.pdf)

**Zhijing Wan**, Zhixiang Wang, Yuran Wang, Zheng Wang, Hongyuan Zhu, and Shin’ichi Satoh

- For the first time in coreset selection, we explicitly introduce information on the Contributing Dimension Structure (CDS) via the proposed CDS metric to enrich the diversity of CDS in the coreset.
